### Hello Everyone, this is a website about my Princess and Prince, that live with me and my wife in Japan.  Lolita is a female dog and Bianchi is a male cat.  I got Lolita from the SPCA in San Diego CA.  Bianchi we got in Hiroshima.  Lolita has been with us for 9 years and Bianchi for 2 years.  They get along for the most part, but Lolita tends to get upset with him and the fun stops there.  Hope you like their photos.
